# Radio Frequnecy Interference in SAR Data

This project aims to intially develop Radar Interference Tracker (RIT) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 satellites to identify active radar systems by detecting radio frequency interference (RFI) based on the capabilities of the Bellingcat RIT tool. Uisng the SAR data identify of radar parameters in new datasets. All code is written in Python. For more details, visit the Bellingcat website here.
